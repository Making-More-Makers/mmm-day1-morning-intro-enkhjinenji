### Our Team Dynamics | 我们的团队动态

**Who took the leadership role? | 谁担任了领导角色？**

Unfortunately, I arrived late to the challenge due to a previous meeting, so I didn't witness who took the initial leadership role. Based on what I observed when I arrived, it appeared that the team worked collaboratively without a single designated leader.

**How did we divide the work? | 我们如何分工？**

Since I arrived late, my teammates had already started working. From what I could see, they seemed to work together on different aspects - some focusing on building the base, others working on the structure. By the time I arrived, they had already established their workflow.

**Did everyone contribute equally? | 每个人的贡献是否平等？**

I was late because of previous meeting. So the rest of my teammates completed the work.

## ✅ What Worked Well | 什么做得好

### Successful Strategies | 成功的策略

**What was our initial strategy? | 我们最初的策略是什么？**

Based on the final structure's height of 50cm, it seems the team attempted to build vertically. I should have asked my teammates about their initial approach when I arrived.

**What worked better than expected? | 什么比预期的效果更好？**


**What would you do the same way if you did it again? | 如果再做一次，你会用同样的方法做什么？**

I would ensure better time management to arrive on time and be part of the initial planning and strategy discussion. However, I would maintain the same collaborative spirit I observed in my teammates.

## ❌ What Failed | 什么失败了

### Challenges We Faced | 我们面临的挑战

**What didn't work as planned? | 什么没有按计划进行？**

The height was the problem but it was very resistant

**Why do you think it failed? | 你认为为什么失败了？**




**What was the biggest challenge? | 最大的挑战是什么？**

From my perspective, the biggest challenge was arriving late and not being able to fully participate or help my team. For the team overall, the challenge was likely creating a stable structure that could support the marshmallow for 5 seconds while reaching a good height.

## 🔄 Iterations | 迭代

### How We Adapted | 我们如何适应

**How many different designs did we try? | 我们尝试了多少种不同的设计？**

☐ 1  ☑ 2-3  ☐ 4-5  ☐ 6+

**Describe one major change we made during the challenge | 描述我们在挑战中做出的一个重大改变**

Based on the structure that was completed, I suspect the team may have needed to adjust the base or the support structure when they realized the initial design wasn't stable enough. However, I cannot provide specific details since I arrived late and missed the iterative process.



**Did testing early help us? | 早期测试对我们有帮助吗？**

I believe early testing would have been crucial. Testing the structure's stability early on would have revealed weaknesses before the final minutes, allowing time for adjustments. However, since I wasn't present for the full challenge, I cannot confirm whether early testing occurred or how effective it was.

## 🤝 Teamwork Lessons | 团队合作的经验

### What We Learned About Collaboration | 我们从协作中学到了什么

**What worked well in our team communication? | 我们团队沟通中什么做得好？**

My teammates were able to continue working effectively even when I was delayed. They maintained their focus and didn't let my absence disrupt the entire team's progress. They were understanding about my situation when I arrived.

**What could we have done better as a team? | 作为一个团队，我们可以做得更好的是什么？**

As a team, we could have better coordinated timing to ensure all members were present from the start. I could have communicated my potential delay earlier. We could have also done better testing and iteration of the structure design to improve stability.

**How did we handle disagreements? | 我们如何处理分歧？**




**Did we listen to everyone's ideas? | 我们有听取每个人的想法吗？**

## ⏱️ Time Management | 时间管理

### How We Used Our 18 Minutes | 我们如何使用 18 分钟

**How much time did we spend planning vs. building? | 我们花了多少时间规划 vs. 建造？**

Planning | 规划: ___~3-5__ minutes (based on typical challenge structure, though I wasn't present)  
Building | 建造: ___~13-15__ minutes

**Did we have time left over or run out of time? | 我们有剩余时间还是时间不够？**

We would build more higher if we had more time.

**Was our time management effective? | 我们的时间管理有效吗？**

Yes

## 🔧 Engineering Thinking | 工程思维

### Design Process | 设计过程

**Did we test our structure before the final measurement? | 我们在最终测量前测试我们的结构了吗？**

☐ Yes, multiple times  
☐ Yes, once or twice  
☑ No, we ran out of time  
☐ No, we didn't think to test it

**What would we change if we had 5 more minutes? | 如果我们还有 5 分钟，我们会改变什么？**

With 5 more minutes, we would definitely test the structure's stability and make adjustments to the base or support structure. We could strengthen weak points, widen the base if needed, or redistribute the weight to ensure the marshmallow wouldn't cause collapse.

**What engineering principles did we discover? | 我们发现了什么工程原理？**

*For example: triangles are stable, base needs to be wide, weight distribution, etc.*  
*例如：三角形是稳定的、底座需要宽、重量分布等*

Through this challenge, we learned (or confirmed) that: the base needs to be wide and stable to support height; weight distribution is critical - the marshmallow at the top can be too heavy for thin supports; testing is essential before declaring a structure complete; and vertical height requires strong vertical supports or a different structural approach like a pyramid.

## 🎓 Lessons Learned | 学到的经验

### Key Takeaways | 关键收获

**The most important thing I learned from this challenge | 我从这个挑战中学到的最重要的事情**

The most important thing I learned is the critical importance of time management and being present from the beginning of collaborative projects. 

**One thing I would definitely do differently next time | 下次我肯定会做得不同的一件事**

Time management and early testing would be my top priorities.

**How does this challenge relate to real maker projects? | 这个挑战如何与真实的创客项目相关？**

*Think about: prototyping, iteration, teamwork, time constraints, resource limits*  
*思考：原型制作、迭代、团队合作、时间限制、资源限制*

This challenge mirrors real maker projects in several ways: we worked with limited materials (spaghetti and marshmallow); had strict time constraints (18 minutes); needed to prototype and iterate quickly; required effective teamwork and communication; and learned that testing early and often is crucial. The failure of our structure reflects the iterative nature of maker work - we learn from what doesn't work to improve future designs.

### Applying This to My Project | 将这应用到我的项目

**How will today's experience help with my maker project? | 今天的经历将如何帮助我的创客项目？**

Today's experience taught me the importance of punctuality, planning, testing, and teamwork. I'll apply these lessons by ensuring I'm present for all planning sessions, allocating time for testing and iteration in my project timeline, and maintaining open communication with teammates throughout the project.

**What team skills do I want to develop more? | 我想更多发展哪些团队技能？**

I want to develop better time management skills, active listening, and proactive communication. I also want to improve my ability to contribute ideas effectively in team settings and learn how to facilitate better collaboration when challenges arise.

**What would I do differently in my final project based on this experience? | 根据这次经历，我在最终项目中会做什么不同的事？**

I would: 1) Ensure I'm present from the project's start; 2) Allocate specific time for testing and iteration throughout; 3) Communicate potential scheduling conflicts early; 4) Take a more active role in planning and execution; and 5) Build in buffer time for unexpected challenges.

## 💬 Personal Reflection | 个人反思

### How I Felt | 我的感受

**What was the most frustrating moment? | 最令人沮丧的时刻是什么？**

The most frustrating moment was arriving late and realizing I had missed the initial planning and strategy discussion. It was frustrating to feel like I couldn't fully contribute to my team's effort, especially when I saw they had already made significant progress without me.

**What was the most exciting moment? | 最激动人心的时刻是什么？**

Seeing the completed structure, even though it didn't stand, was still exciting. There was anticipation during the final testing to see if it would hold. Learning from this experience and reflecting on what went wrong is also exciting because it's an opportunity for growth.

**Did I surprise myself in any way? | 我有没有在某方面让自己惊讶？**

I was surprised (and disappointed) by how much my late arrival impacted my ability to contribute. I realized that even small timing issues can significantly affect team dynamics and project outcomes. This awareness surprised me in terms of understanding the importance of punctuality in collaborative work.

**On a scale of 1-10, how much fun did I have? | 按 1-10 的标度，我玩得有多开心？**

☐ 1 ☐ 2 ☐ 3 ☐ 4 ☐ 5 ☑ 6 ☐ 7 ☐ 8 ☐ 9 ☐ 10

(I rated it a 6 because while I learned valuable lessons, my limited participation due to arriving late reduced the overall fun and engagement I could have had)
