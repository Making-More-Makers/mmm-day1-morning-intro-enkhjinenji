## ⚖️ Why Completion-Only? | 为什么只记录完成？

This assignment is **not numerically graded** because:

- It's the first day - we want to encourage participation without fear
- The goal is self-reflection, not performance
- We want honest answers, not "right" answers
- It establishes a baseline for growth
- It helps instructors understand each student's starting point

However, thoughtful completion is expected and required.

此作业 **不计数字分数** 因为：

- 这是第一天 - 我们想鼓励参与而不害怕
- 目标是自我反思，而不是表现
- 我们想要诚实的答案，而不是"正确"的答案
- 它为成长建立了基准
- 它帮助讲师了解每个学生的起点

但是，需要经过深思熟虑的完成。
